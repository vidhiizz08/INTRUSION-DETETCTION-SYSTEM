# INTRUSION-DETETCTION-SYSTEM
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a device or software application that monitors a
network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Any intrusion activity or
violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security
information and event management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines outputs from
multiple sources and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from
false alarms.
Although Intrusion Detection Systems monitor networks for potentially malicious activity,
they are also disposed to false alarms. Hence, organizations need to fine-tune their IDS
products when they first install them. It means properly setting up the intrusion detection
systems to recognize what normal traffic on the network looks like as compared to malicious
activity.
